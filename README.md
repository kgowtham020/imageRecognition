ver 2 : 1st basic version
ver 3 : added shap plots and feature engineering
ver 4 : hyperparameter optimization by Optuna
ver 9 : reverting to float64 due to rounding errors with float32
ver 10 : added cv predictions, error analysis, shap summary by stacked bars
ver 11 : added blending with a LightGBM model
ver 12 : using Nelder-Mean optimization for best blend weights
ver 13 : implemented individual target blend weight optimization
ver 14 : testing multi:softprob
ver 15 : reverting to softmax, updating LightGBM hyperparameters
